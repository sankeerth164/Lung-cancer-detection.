# Lung-cancer-detection.
CNN-based deep learning model to classify histopathological images of lung and colon cancer into Adenocarcinoma, Large Cell Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Normal tissue. Achieved ~95% validation accuracy using TensorFlow/Keras, data augmentation, and class balancing.


Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify histopathological images of lung and colon cancer into four categories:
1. Adenocarcinoma
2. Large Cell Carcinoma
3. Squamous Cell Carcinoma
4. Normal Tissue

The model aims to assist in early cancer diagnosis by automating the classification process, reducing human error, and supporting medical professionals.
